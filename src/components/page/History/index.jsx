              <h5 className="fs mb-10">Before the Monarchy</h5>
              <p className="mb-10">
                Available information about this period has been quite sketchy
                and derived mainly from oral tradition that has existed since
                before records. What has been established, however, is that some
                people groups of Yoruba, Nupe and Igala origins came at
                different times and were the core groups that constituted the
                Itsekiri nation.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                Research still has to be done to provide more information in
                this area. This is more so when we consider that the Ebu people
                in Delta North of Nigeria have words and language formations
                similar to those of the Itsekiri language. Likewise, the Oworo
                people of Kogi State in the North of Nigeria also have a similar
                linguistic affinity.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                These are no neighbours at all but are far removed from one
                another and with several other and very different ethnic
                nationalities between them and us. It cannot be said that such
                traces of linguistic affinity was derived from proximity or
                other forms of contact and interaction over an extended period
                for that to have been developed.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                It is instructive to note that such linguistic affinity does not
                exist between Edo and Itsekiri even though the Edo group, which
                was the last of the people group, came and joined us since from
                over five centuries ago. This means that by the time they
                arrived that long ago, the Itsekiri language had been set and
                was well established already. The only traces of Edo in the
                Itsekiri language are in royal and chieftaincy matters and
                references. This is understandable because those institutions
                came from the Benin Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                One thing that can be firmly stated is that by the fifteenth
                century, the core of the Itsekiri nation had been established.
                It was only to be affected by the factors of growth dynamics.

              <h5 className="fs">The Monarchy</h5>
              <p className="mb-10">
                The monarchical era covered from 1480 to 1848 AD, about 360
                years of an uninterrupted period when kings ruled the kingdom.
                Sixteen (16 kings) Olus reigned in succession during this period
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                As this era progressed, so did the Iwere Kingdom grow in the
                development of our governance, world view, socio-cultural values
                and practices and religion. The result was greatly enhanced
                through our early contact with Europeans, some of whom lived
                among us as Industrialists and international businessmen. For
                instance, the place called JAMANI (our name for Germany), which
                is very close to the mouth of the OLERO River in Warri North
                Local Government Area, got that name from being an Industrial
                Base of some German industrialists who had settled there.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                This was when Christian missionaries came, most from Portugal
                and lived among us at the request of the Olu of Iwere (as the
                Olu of Warri was then known) who did so in a letter to the Pope.
                This was also when we subsequently had the then Crown Prince,
                who went at his father’s instance to Portugal for his University
                education and as a guest of the Royal Court of Portugal.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                He was the one who gave the commission for the Warri Monarch’s
                Crown to be made with the Cross of Jesus Christ at its top to
                signify that his kingdom (The Iwere Kingdom as it was then
                known) was under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. His Majesty
                Atuwatse, brought materials of the Order of Christ which have
                since been part of the regalia of the Olu of Warri. These were
                made and have been in use for over 350 years. The concept and
                the mode of the regalia of the Chiefs of Warri Kingdom were also
                derived from this source.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                There is a sense in which it could be rightly said that this era
                was like the golden age for us as a people. This is because we
                were on our own, under our king and followed our system of
                governance. We related with others as equals, whether they be
                Europeans or fellow Africans. We enslaved others who had a good
                measure of life, making them proud to be part of us. Our
                territory was intact. No people invaded us to take our land, nor
                did we fight any expansionist war to take other people’s land.

            <div className="w mt-70">
              <h5 className="fs">The Interregnum</h5>
              <p className="mb-10">
                This is a period of eighty-eight (88) years which began in 1848
                AD after the demise of Olu Akengbuwa. All attempts to have a
                succeeding Olu failed, one after the other. We then had
                Governors who were appointed. We had four of them in succession,
                which began with Diare, an Omajaja. He was succeeded by
                Tsaninomi (also spelt Chaninomi), an Otonolu, who succeeded
                Olomu, another Omajaja. Finally, he was succeeded by Nanna (real
                name is EREOMALA which was corrupted by Europeans to Nanna), who
                was one of his sons.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                The Governors knew they were appointed to govern in trust for
                the kingdom on behalf of the Olu and conducted themselves as
                such. Among other duties, they collected customs and additional
                revenues from foreigners who came on business and handled all
                external affairs on behalf of the throne. Moreover, they knew
                they would cease functioning as soon as an Olu was crowned.
                Therefore, they were also accountable in that regard.

                He finally arrived in Lagos, where he first met his friend,
                Akitoye, the then Oba of Lagos. After discussing with his
                friend, he turned himself into the British in Lagos, which was
                already a British Colony at the time.

              <h5 className="fs">Our Fusion with Others</h5>
              <p className="mb-10">
                Although that war ended the era of the Governors, the
                interregnum continued. This time, however, Warri Kingdom was
                fused into what became The Southern Protectorate under colonial
                Britain. Chief Dure Numa (real name is Omadoghogbone which the
                British corrupted to Dure) was appointed by the British as a
                Paramount Chief who ruled under colonial Britain..
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                Before the war, our relationship with the British was purely on
                commerce, just like we had with other European groups. But, as
                it turned out, the British expanded their interests beyond trade
                to colonization.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                On the demise of Dure Numa in 1932, the clamour for the return
                to our Monarchy finally gained ground and brought the 88 years
                of the interregnum to its end. By this time, Iwere had since
                become Warri, and Itsekiri had become Jekri, as the British
                preferred to call them. Warri was then the Headquarters of Warri
                Province under the British Colonial Administration.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                Although the Monarchy returned in 1936 with the crowning of his
                Majesty Ginuwa II, it was no longer the same. This was because
                the Iwere Kingdom was now part of Warri Province over which
                Chief Dure Numa exercised authority no longer on behalf of the
                Olu of Iwereland as the four Itsekiri Governors were and did,
                but now on behalf of the British colonial Crown.

              <h5 className="fs">A Part of Nigeria</h5>
              <p className="mb-10">
                By the time we returned to the Monarchy in 1936 with the
                crowning of His Majesty Ogiame Ginuwa II, Nigeria had existed as
                an entity for twenty-two (22) years with the amalgamation of the
                Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914 which brought this
                about.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-10">
                As we became part of Nigeria, we ceased to be entirely on our
                own, just like the other component ethnic nationalities that
                constitute the Nigerian nation-state. This is why the return of
                the Monarchy did not amount to the system we had from the
                beginning. Instead, our fortunes had become tied to that of the
                others as well.
